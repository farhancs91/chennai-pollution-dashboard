## Problem
Air pollution and noise pollution are two major problems in cities like Chennai. They affect our health, studies, and quality of life.  

- **Air pollution** (measured by PM2.5 dust in the air) can cause asthma, breathing trouble, and long-term illness.  
- **Noise pollution** (measured in decibels) can cause stress, sleep problems, and hearing damage.  

---

## My Solution
I built a **Chennai Pollution Dashboard** that:  
- Shows **Air vs Noise pollution** on a map of Chennai.  
- Covers **40+ localities** (T. Nagar, Anna Nagar, Adyar, Velachery, Royapuram, Tambaram, etc.).  
- Includes a **Top-5 chart** showing the worst affected areas.  
- Includes a **Compare chart** showing the relationship between air and noise pollution.  
- Lets you **filter by locality**, works on phone or laptop.

## Tools Used
- **HTML, CSS (Tailwind)** ‚Üí Layout and styling  
- **Leaflet.js** ‚Üí Interactive map  
- **Chart.js** ‚Üí Graphs  
- **Papa Parse** ‚Üí Load data from CSV file  
- **GitHub Pages** ‚Üí Free hosting

## Insights
- **Ennore, Royapuram, Perambur** show high air pollution due to industries and traffic.  
- **Koyambedu, T. Nagar, Velachery** show high noise levels due to traffic congestion.  
- Some localities (e.g., **Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur**) have relatively lower levels.

## Safety Tips
- Wear a mask on high-pollution days.  
- Avoid outdoor play near busy roads.  
- Prefer quieter routes for walking or cycling.  
- Plant more trees in neighborhoods.
