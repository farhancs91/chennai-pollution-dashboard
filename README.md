Problem

Air pollution and noise pollution are two major problems in cities like Chennai. They affect our health, studies, and quality of life.

Air pollution (measured by PM2.5 dust in the air) can cause asthma, breathing trouble, and long-term illness.

Noise pollution (measured in decibels) can cause stress, sleep problems, and hearing damage.

My Solution

I built a Chennai Pollution Dashboard:

Shows Air vs Noise pollution on a map of Chennai.

Covers 40+ localities (T. Nagar, Anna Nagar, Adyar, Velachery, Royapuram, Tambaram, etc.).

Top-5 chart shows the worst affected areas.

Compare chart shows the relationship between air and noise pollution.

Can filter by locality, easy to use on phone or laptop.

Tools Used

HTML, CSS (Tailwind) â†’ Layout and styling

Leaflet.js â†’ Interactive map

Chart.js â†’ Graphs

Papa Parse â†’ Load data from CSV file

GitHub Pages â†’ Free hosting

Insights

Ennore, Royapuram, Perambur show high air pollution due to industries and traffic.

Koyambedu, T. Nagar, Velachery show high noise levels due to traffic congestion.

Some localities (e.g., Besant Nagar, Thiruvanmiyur) have relatively lower levels.

Safety Tips

Wear a mask on high-pollution days.

Avoid outdoor play near busy roads.

Prefer quieter routes for walking or cycling.

Plant more trees in neighborhoods.

What I Learned

How to collect and organize data in CSV.
